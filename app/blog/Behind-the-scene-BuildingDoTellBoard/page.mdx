## Building Standup Magic: A Peek Behind the Curtain

We're building a platform to streamline project management, focusing on automated stand-up notifications, team collaboration, and insightful AI-powered summaries. This week has been a whirlwind of coding, problem-solving, and even a bit of rebranding panic! Let's dive into the details.

**Saul's Sprint: Notifications and the Rise of the Response Tracker**

Saul kicked things off by tackling a core piece of our functionality: hourly UTC notifications for active projects. The goal is to ensure everyone stays on track, regardless of their timezone. He also implemented a response tracker to capture user check-in submissions, integrating it beautifully with the frontend. This is crucial for monitoring project progress and understanding individual contributions. But the real exciting part? Saul's planning to integrate the Google Gemini API to summarize these check-in responses, automatically identifying diversions, blockers, and key insights. Imagine the power of instantly knowing if a project is veering off course!

**Adegoke's Sharp Eye and the Power of Code Review**

No project is perfect, and that's where Adegoke shines! After Saul's initial implementation, Adegoke dived into the code, acting as a critical first line of defense. He identified some naming inconsistencies and implementation issues within the notification system. This highlights the importance of code reviews in ensuring code quality and maintainability. Thanks to Adegoke's keen eye, we're catching potential problems early.

**Beyond Notifications: Google Sign-in, AI Insights, and the Road to Monetization**

Adegoke didn't stop at code review. He's also been working tirelessly on Google Sign-in, making the onboarding process seamless for our users. Next up, he'll be focusing on displaying those AI-generated insights that Saul is building, giving users instant access to the collective wisdom of their team's stand-up responses. And looking ahead, Adegoke is already strategizing about payment and subscription features â€“ the backbone of any sustainable platform.

**Mobile Horizons and Pricing Strategies**

While Adegoke focused on frontend and backend integrations, Saul took a deep dive into the world of mobile framework development in C#. This signals our commitment to making the platform accessible across devices. He also started exploring different pricing strategies. We want to ensure our pricing is fair, competitive, and reflects the value we provide to our users.

**Editing Projects and Sending Reminders: Polishing the User Experience**

Adegoke continues to refine the core functionality. He successfully built the edit function for projects, empowering users to make changes on the fly. Currently, he's working on integrating the ability to send reminders, ensuring that no stand-up is ever missed.

**Brand Identity Crisis!**

This is where things got interesting. Adegoke's marketing and production research uncovered a potential naming conflict! This threw a wrench in our plans, forcing us to scramble for alternatives. It's a stark reminder that even the best-laid plans can be disrupted by unexpected circumstances. 

**The Pivot: New Name, Refreshed Look, and Content Creation Blitz**

Faced with a potential naming conflict, Adegoke sprang into action. He initiated a search for alternative names while simultaneously testing the product, identifying areas for improvement. He also refactored the landing page copy to better reflect our platform's value proposition. Today, he's focusing on creating content for our terms of service and privacy policy (essential for building trust with our users), updating Google Apps settings to reflect the potential name change, redesigning our email templates, and gathering emails for our initial outreach to founders, builders, and PMs. It's a monumental task, but Adegoke's dedication is inspiring!

**Key Takeaways**

This week has been a rollercoaster of progress, challenges, and unexpected detours. We've made significant strides in building the core functionality of our stand-up platform, integrating AI insights, and planning for the future. The naming conflict threw us for a loop, but it also highlighted the importance of adaptability and quick thinking. We're a small but mighty team, and we're excited to share our journey with you as we continue to build something truly special.
