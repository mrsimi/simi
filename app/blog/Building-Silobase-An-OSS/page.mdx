# Building Silobase: A Backend-as-a-Service for Your Own Infrastructure

## Background

I was working on a project that needed an internal dashboard. The frontend would be written in React, and the only backend requirement was to read from a database to generate some charts. No business logic, no authentication layer, no orchestration ‚Äî just a clean API to interact with my existing data.

At first, Supabase and Firebase seemed like great fits. Both are feature-rich Backend-as-a-Service platforms that abstract away infrastructure. But both had a critical limitation:

> **I couldn‚Äôt bring my own database.**

Supabase locks you into a managed PostgreSQL instance. Firebase forces you to use Firestore or Realtime Database. My setup already had a SQL database running ‚Äî I just needed a way to expose it via HTTP, without spinning up a custom Express server or writing boilerplate code.

That was the moment I decided to build **Silobase** ‚Äî an open-source BaaS that doesn‚Äôt pick your infrastructure for you.


## Goals

Silobase was built around a few core principles:

- ‚úÖ **Bring your own infrastructure**  
  Use existing PostgreSQL, MSSQL, or other SQL databases.

- ‚úÖ **Zero backend code**  
  Don‚Äôt write APIs manually ‚Äî configure everything via `.env`.

- ‚úÖ **Frontend-first developer experience**  
  Build your UI however you want ‚Äî React, Vue, or even raw HTML.

- ‚úÖ **Fast, minimal setup**  
  Plug in your config and deploy it anywhere in minutes.

- ‚úÖ **Self-hosted and open-source**  
  No vendor lock-in or opaque services.


## What Is Silobase?

Silobase is a minimal Backend-as-a-Service layer that exposes your database (and soon file storage, queues, and more) over a RESTful HTTP API ‚Äî with no backend code.

It connects to your infrastructure using a simple `.env` configuration and translates HTTP requests into SQL operations. You can use it to instantly read and write data from any frontend without building or maintaining a backend.

## Key Features

- üîå **Bring your own database**: PostgreSQL and MSSQL supported now. MySQL and SQLite support coming soon.
- üåê **Instant REST API**: CRUD over HTTP for any table in your database.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Zero-code configuration**: Controlled entirely by environment variables.
- üóÇ **Pluggable file storage** (coming soon): Support for AWS S3, Azure Blob, and more.
- üì¨ **Extensible service layer** (planned): Email, queues, and caching via connectors.

## Architecture

Silobase is a lightweight HTTP server that acts as a proxy layer between your frontend and infrastructure. The stack uses **Fastify** for HTTP handling and **Knex.js** as the SQL query builder.

### Component Overview

```text
[ Client Application ]
          ‚îÇ
          ‚ñº
   HTTP Request
          ‚îÇ
+------------------------+
|     Silobase API       |
|------------------------|
| ‚Ä¢ REST Handler         |
| ‚Ä¢ Config Loader        |
| ‚Ä¢ DB Connector         |
| ‚Ä¢ File Gateway (soon)  |
+------------------------+
          ‚îÇ
          ‚ñº
[ PostgreSQL / MSSQL / etc. ]
````

* **REST Handler**: Maps HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to CRUD operations.
* **DB Connector**: Connects via Knex.js using `.env` settings.
* **Config Loader**: Parses environment variables to set up routes and permissions.
* **File Gateway**: A planned module to route file upload/download operations to cloud storage providers.

## API Design

Silobase follows standard REST semantics. Each table becomes a RESTful endpoint:

```
GET    /api/:table          ‚Üí SELECT * FROM table
GET    /api/:table/:id      ‚Üí SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = :id
POST   /api/:table          ‚Üí INSERT INTO table ...
PUT    /api/:table/:id      ‚Üí UPDATE table SET ... WHERE id = :id
DELETE /api/:table/:id      ‚Üí DELETE FROM table WHERE id = :id
```

Requests are automatically mapped to SQL queries with support for filters, pagination, and sorting.

## Configuration

Everything is managed through environment variables ‚Äî no need to write code or generate schemas.

Example `.env` file:

```env
SILOBASE_DB_CLIENT=pg
SILOBASE_DB_HOST=localhost
SILOBASE_DB_PORT=5432
SILOBASE_DB_USER=admin
SILOBASE_DB_PASSWORD=secret
SILOBASE_DB_NAME=my_database

# Optional future extensions
SILOBASE_FILE_PROVIDER=aws
SILOBASE_FILE_BUCKET=my-bucket
```

Once deployed, you can start making HTTP requests to access your data.

Silobase is ideal when you already have infrastructure in place and just want to expose it cleanly. It‚Äôs not trying to be a full developer platform ‚Äî it‚Äôs a simple connector between your stack and your UI.


### üöÄ Roadmap

#### ‚úÖ Currently Supported

* **Database:** PostgreSQL, MSSQL

#### üîú Coming Soon

* **Database:** MySQL, SQLite
* **File Storage:** AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage
* **Email:** SMTP, Mailgun, SendGrid
* **Queues:** Redis, SQS (planned)




## Deployment

Silobase is designed for easy self-hosting. You can deploy it on:

* [Render](https://render.com/)
* [AWS ECS / Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
* [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

Each deployment only requires a `.env` file and a Docker container or Node.js runtime.

## Try It

Silobase is available on GitHub: [github.com/your-org/silobase](https://github.com/your-org/silobase)

Star it, fork it, open an issue, or send a PR. Contributions are welcome ‚Äî especially around adapters and third-party provider support.

## Final Thoughts

Silobase isn‚Äôt a full-fledged platform. It‚Äôs a minimal interface layer that gives you freedom over your infrastructure without writing backend logic. It‚Äôs for developers who:

* Already have a database
* Want a fast way to expose data
* Prefer building custom UIs
* Need to avoid vendor lock-in

If that sounds like you, give Silobase a shot and let me know what you think.
